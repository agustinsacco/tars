`GEMINI.md` is the "Scratchpad" of Tars' brain. It contains the most immediate and relevant information about you and your environment.

## The Content of Memory

- **Personal Preferences**: How you like your code formatted, your name, and your role.
- **Active Objectives**: What Tars is currently trying to accomplish.
- **Global Rules**: Critical constraints Tars must follow.
- **System context**: Descriptions of the current repository and architecture.

## Managing Growth

Tars is instructed to keep this file concise. When it gets too large, Tars will:
1. **Summarize**: Condense old history into bullet points.
2. **Move**: Relocate facts to the **Hippocampus** (Knowledge System).
3. **Refine**: Ensure the most important rules are always at the top.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This file is your primary way to "train" Tars. Just tell Tars to "remember" something, and it will update this file.
