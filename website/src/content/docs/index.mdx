## The Philosophy of Tars

Tars isn't just a chatbot; it's a **Digital Nervous System** for your local machine. Built on top of Google's Gemini, Tars leverages lightning-fast inference to manage your environment, automate your tasks, and remember your preferences.

		Tars doesn't wait for you. It wakes up, checks its state, and acts autonomously.

		Every interaction refines Tars' understanding of your goals via `GEMINI.md`.

## Functional Anatomy

To understand Tars, think of it like a biological system.

- **The Frontal Lobe (Supervisor)**: Orchestrates decisions and communication.
- **The Autonomic System (Heartbeat)**: Handles background maintenance and proactive checks.
- **The Hippocampus (Knowledge)**: Manages long-term factual retrieval.
- **The Working Memory (GEMINI.md)**: Maintains your current focus and preferences.
